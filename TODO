Known issues/TODO (for steady-state)

- Does not work over a network connection

- Add output for --output-format=normal

- Allow user to specify the frequency of measurements

- Better documentation for output

- Report read, write, trim IOPS/BW separately

- Semantics for the ring buffer ss->head are confusing. ss->head points
  to the beginning of the buffer up through the point where the buffer
  is filled for the first time. afterwards, when a new element is added,
  ss->head is advanced to point to the second element in the buffer. if
  steady state is attained upon adding a new element, ss->head is not
  advanced so it actually does point to the head of the buffer.

- Update man page (HOWTO already done)
